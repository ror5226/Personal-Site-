				<div class ="about-me">
				<p>Hi there! I am a third year software engineering student at Penn State Erie, the Behrend College. I love to express my creativity in the software that I develop. So far my courses have been based around mastery of Object Oriented Programming using Java and C++. I have also been pursuing an interest in game design using C# and Javascript. Outside of the classroom I have been continuing my education with technical internships at the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> and <a href="http://globoplc.com">Globo Mobile Technology</a></br></br>
				I love to meet others who share similar passions as mine at hackathons, tech summits and conferences. At my last hackathon I was recognized by <a href="http://blog.blockchain.com/2015/03/31/our-hackpsu-recap/">Blockchain</a>  for my teamâ€™s educational Bitcoin faucet app we developed in 24 hours. I was also recently chosen to attend VMware's Fearless Student Leader Summit! However, most importantly I like to give back to my collegiate community by taking on leadership positions in the organizations that I care most about. My ultimate goal is that my passion for software will inspire others to try it out for themselves. </br> </br> Feel free to look around at my <a href="about_me.html">current projects</a>, <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and if you'd like, <a href="contact_me.html">contact me!</a> I am currently seeking an internship position for Summer 2016. </br></br> </p>
