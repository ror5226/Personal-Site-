							Princess vs. Frogs is a third person shooter I created in C# within Unity3D. In this game, you play as Princess Penny as she tries to escape from her frog infested castle. Since many video games are geared towards boys, PvF was develped as a game that younger girls could play and not feel masked behind a male persona. Even though Princess vs. Frogs started as a class final project, I will continue improving it as I become more skilled with 3D modelling and video game development.

							Coin Rider is an original idea created to act as a Bitcoin faucet that was fun and informative. It is a mobile application created within 24 hours by myself and a group of three other developers who were drawn in by my pitch during the HackPSU 2015 event. We coded in C# within Unity3D to interface with Blockchain's API. Through their API, we created Bitcoin wallets within the app and obtained the real time value of Bitcoin. Thanks to the ingenuity of my project, our team won the Blockchain's Best Use of API Award. </p>

								Life Line is an Android application created within 24 hours during the WiCHacks 2015 event at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It was written in Java using Android Studio. Life Line provides students a discrete way of contacting on-campus emergency assistance. My focus during development was implementing a key feature that allowed users to draw symbols or icons in order to store them as contact images. This allowed the user to call or text for help without arousing any suspicion from bystanders. We won the Best Hack for Woman Award and the Most Innovative Award.

								Moral Moonwalk is an adventure game created within 48 hours using Construct 2 during the Global Game Jam 2015 event. In the game, two friends must make their way out of a strange hospital so they can arrive at a party in time. For this project, I focused on creating storyboards for the game and using Adobe Photoshop to draw the sprite sheets for the various characters.

								Paint Project is a copmuter graphics program that allows users to draw with a variety of tools, as well as save or print their work. It was written in Java using the NetBeans IDE. This was my final project for my Software Engineering 311 class at The Pennsylvania State University. As one of my initial projects, it helped me understand important concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance. </p>

								Tech Start is a board game that allows players to experience the trials and rewards of starting a technology company. Players begin with three employees and must work their way up in the corporate world, helping and sabotaging other player's companies along the way. Victory goes to the player that can first reach the company goal of one million dollars! Tech Start was created as a final project for a game design course at The Pennsylvania State University. Our team had to design and plan the game's premise, mechanics, and components; the entire game was made by a professional board game production company. </p>
